HPCViewer Install Notes
========================

Requirements:
- Java 1.5 (at least)
- GTk 


1. Linux/Unix

To install hpcviewer, unpack the tar file, cd into its directory (the
directory containing this README file) and run:

   ./install dir

where "dir" is the top-level hpctoolkit install directory, the same
directory specified as --prefix in hpctoolkit's configure.

Note: the normal procedure is first to compile and install hpctoolkit,
and then install hpcviewer into the same prefix directory.  It is not
necessary to install hpctoolkit first, but in that case, the hpcviewer
install script will issue a warning and ask for confirmation.


2. Mac OS X

No installation procedures required


3. Windows
